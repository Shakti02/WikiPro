# WikiPro
The extension is changing the new tab
A simple but very useful extension and also Instant Text to Speech Converter tool. A lot of time while surfing on internet users might not be able to understand a lot
of terms/terminologies. They might have to explicitly search on google, or go to Wikipedia then search it. To solve the exact problem, this very app is helpful. I saves
your time and search. you just need to highlight that word and right click on it. You will see the a option hinting to search at Wikipedia. Just click on it, a new window
with full of knowledge about that term shows up.


How To Use?
